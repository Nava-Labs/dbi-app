The Decentralized Bureau of Investigation (**DBI**) is a community-based platform aimed at enhancing communication during the crucial initial hours after a security breach or rug pull. It connects affected protocols, hackers, and the community for effective collaboration.

### Key Features:

* Secure Data Storage: Lighthouse Storage for encrypted data keeping. 
* Live Communication: Offers real-time chats via Push Protocol. 
* Supports Multiple Chains: Compatible with Polygon, Arbitrum, Scroll, Base, and Mantle.

### For Projects/Protocols:
* Organization Creation: Authenticate using Wallet, Polygon ID, and Log in with X.
* Community-Driven Cases: permissionless case creation by token holders.
* Automated Bounty System: Rewards hackers through smart contracts.
* Private Communication with Hackers: Facilitates discreet p2p chat with the hacker.
* Decentralized Report Submission: Secure and decentralized reporting process.

### For the Community:
* Case and Bounty Initiation: Allows starting cases and setting up bounties independently (for rug pull cases).
* Open Group Chats: Dedicated chat for each case.
* Open Space: Dedicate Space (audio) for each case.
* Report and Earn: Rewards for contributing valuable insights.
